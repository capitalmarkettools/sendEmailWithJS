This is the 7th in a series of posts leading up to Node.js Knockout on using Nodemailer. This post was written by Node Knockout judge and Nodemailer creator Andris Reinman.
tl;dr — How to send an e-mail using Nodemailer

Install Nodemailer
> npm install nodemailer
Include the module in your script and create a reusable transport object
var nodemailer = require("nodemailer");

var smtpTransport = nodemailer.createTransport("SMTP",{
   service: "Gmail",
   auth: {
       user: "gmail.user@gmail.com",
       pass: "gmailpass"
   }
});
Send an e-mail using the connection object
smtpTransport.sendMail({
   from: "My Name <me@example.com>", // sender address
   to: "Your Name <you@example.com>", // comma separated list of receivers
   subject: "Hello ✔", // Subject line
   text: "Hello world ✔" // plaintext body
}, function(error, response){
   if(error){
       console.log(error);
   }else{
       console.log("Message sent: " + response.message);
   }
});
Send another e-mail without caring about the outcome (or add the callback function as well, like in the previous code block, if you do care)
smtpTransport.sendMail({
   from: "My Name <me@example.com>", // sender address
   to: "Your Name <you@example.com>", // comma separated list of receivers
   subject: "Hello ✔", // Subject line
   text: "Hello world ✔" // plaintext body
});
